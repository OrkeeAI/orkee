Features that might seem related but are out of scope\n2. Common feature requests that don't align with the core value proposition\n3. Technical capabilities that are unnecessary for MVP\n4. Integrations or platforms we're not supporting initially\n5. Edge cases or use cases we're explicitly not addressing\n\nMake this specific and actionable to prevent scope creep.",
