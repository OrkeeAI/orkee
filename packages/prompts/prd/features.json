Prefer extending existing features over creating new ones.\n{{/if}}\n\nGenerate 5-8 core features for an MVP. For each feature, provide:\n\n{\n  \"features\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Feature name\",\n      \"what\": \"What does this feature do?\",\n      \"why\": \"Why is this important for the MVP?\",\n      \"how\": \"High-level approach for implementation\",\n      \"testStrategy\": \"REQUIRED: How will this feature be tested? (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests)\",\n      \"acceptanceCriteria\": [\"List of specific, measurable criteria that define when this feature is complete\"],\n      \"relevantFiles\": [\"List of exact file paths to create or modify (e.g., 'packages/api/src/handlers/feature.rs')\"],\n      \"similarImplementations\": [\"References to similar features in the codebase that can be used as patterns\"],\n      \"reuseOpportunities\": \"Can this leverage existing code?

Foundation features that must be built first\n2. Visible features that users can interact with quickly\n3. Enhancement features that build on the foundation\n4. EVERY feature MUST have a test strategy - no feature is complete without tests\n5. BE SPECIFIC about file paths - provide exact locations, not vague descriptions\n6. IDENTIFY reuse opportunities - what existing code can be leveraged?\n7. MINIMIZE feature count - can features be combined? Can we start simpler?\n\nEnsure dependencies are logical and create a clear build order.",
