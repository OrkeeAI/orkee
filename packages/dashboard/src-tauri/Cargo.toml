# NOTE: macos-private-api is required for set_activation_policy() to control macOS app behavior
# This allows setting Regular policy (shows in Dock/Cmd+Tab) vs Accessory (menu bar only)
# While this uses private APIs, it's a documented Tauri feature for production apps
# Alternative: Accept default Accessory behavior (menu bar only, no Dock icon)
# Risk: Private API changes could break functionality in future macOS versions
