# Ideate Feature - Implementation Progress

## Overview
The Ideate feature provides AI-assisted Product Requirements Document (PRD) creation through three distinct modes: Quick Mode, Guided Mode, and Comprehensive Mode. This document tracks the implementation progress across all phases.

## Architecture

### Backend (Rust)
- **Database**: SQLite with 8 core tables (`ideate_sessions`, `ideate_overview`, `ideate_ux`, `ideate_technical`, `ideate_roadmap`, `ideate_dependencies`, `ideate_risks`, `ideate_research`)
- **Services**: Modular service layer with `prd_aggregator.rs`, `prd_generator.rs`, and `export_service.rs`
- **API**: RESTful endpoints organized by feature area (session management, section management, research, generation)

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, React Query for state management
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Tailwind CSS
- **Structure**: Organized by mode (QuickMode, GuidedMode, ComprehensiveMode) with shared components
